# Cplusplus-Program

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
For this project, I was tasked with creating a banking application which would demonstrate the outcome of different investments. This program would mostly be used to teach students how to responsibly invest and live within their means by plugging in their own amounts in the interactive program.

#What did you do particularly well?
I am particularly proud of being able to create two reports that loop through the amount of years correctly and output the results in an easily readable report. 

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I feel it would be easier to read my code if I had created functions to output the two reports and then called the functions in main() instead of writing the code inside main(). This would also make it easier to manipulate if you only wanted to change part of the code. 

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I actually found it most challenging to get the reports to both line up evenly and look nice. This was my first time using "\t" to line up the output format. It took a lot of running my code and editing to get it perfect.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
First, I think it was very beneficial to learn how to use code to format the output correctly for when I need to create a project in the future maybe for a website that needs to be presented well. It was also beneficial for me to practice using loops to calculate values.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used many comments to explain each part of my code so that if another programmer was to edit it, they would understand what each part does and how it can be manipulated. I also initialized many variables that could be manipulated if need be. I do wish that I had made functions for the two reports as I stated earlier; But this has taught me to use that in the future to make the code more readable and adaptable.
